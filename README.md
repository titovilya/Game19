# The "19"

`I am the first-year student. It is my first program.

The name of the game is "19".
Rules of the game: cross out identical pairs of numbers, or in total giving 10.
Condition: it is necessary that the pairs are near or through the blackened numbers. It is impossible to diagonally.
Numbering the rows from 1 to 3. Numbering the columns from 1 to 9.

Interaction with the program is done through the console. The playing field is displayed in the form of three text lines and redrawn each time the state of the field changes. When requesting data from the user, the program reports what it expects from the user (in particular, the coordinates of the next move) and checks the correctness of the input. The program should be able to automatically determine that you need to write new lines with numbers and that the party is over. The program itself does NOT go, i.e. Don't try to pick pairs of numbers in order to end the game.
